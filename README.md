- 🧠 **Multi-agent status feed** – Real-time progress tracking for vision, nutrition analyst, and culinary expert agents
- 📜 **Local history log** – Revisit previous analyses/recipes, rename entries, and delete old ones
- 💅 **Modern UI** – Tailwind-styled components with responsive layout and interactive charts

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Front End
Single-page application built with:
- **React 18.3** + **TypeScript 5.8**
- **Vite 6.2** for blazing-fast development
- **TailwindCSS** for modern, responsive styling
- **Lucide React** for beautiful icons
- **Recharts** for data visualization

### Multi-Agent System
Implemented using **Google Generative AI SDK** with three specialized agents:

1. **Vision Agent** (`visionAgent`)  
   Analyzes meal images to identify food components and ingredients

2. **Nutrition Analyst** (`nutritionAnalyst`)  
   Calculates detailed nutritional breakdown with macros, micros, and health scoring

3. **Culinary Expert** (`culinaryExpert`)  
   Generates creative recipes based on dietary preferences and available ingredients

### Orchestration
The main orchestration in `App.tsx`:
- User uploads an image
- Vision agent detects ingredients
- Based on workflow selection:
  - **Analysis mode** → Nutrition analyst provides detailed breakdown
  - **Recipe mode** → Culinary expert creates personalized recipe
- Results are logged to localStorage and rendered in beautiful UI components

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version 18.x or newer)
- `npm` (bundled with Node.js)
- **Google Gemini API key** from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd nourishbot-ai-coach
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your Gemini API key:

```env
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

> **⚠️ Security Warning:** This demo exposes the API key client-side for simplicity. For production:
> - Never expose API keys in client-side code
> - Move API calls to a secure backend server
> - Implement proper authentication and rate limiting

### 4. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite will start the dev server at `http://localhost:5173`

### 5. Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The production build will be created in the `dist/` directory.

## 🔐 Data & Privacy

- **Local Storage**: Analysis and recipe history stored in browser's `localStorage`
- **Image Processing**: Images sent to Google Gemini API for analysis
- **No Server Storage**: No data is stored on any backend server
- **API Key Security**: Current implementation exposes API key client-side (demo only)

> **Important:** Do not use this app with sensitive or private photos. For production use, implement proper backend API proxy.
